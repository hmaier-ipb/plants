This README is used as a notepad for my train of thoughts concerning:
->epiphanys about logic of the different languages used
->the logic of my own implemented functions
->things I can't understand


HTML inside content.class.php:
  ->card_html: CSS stored in style_main.css
  ->dropdown_html: CSS stored in style_main.css
  ->checkout_html: CSS stored in style_main.css

scroll-snap-type wurde auf <html> angewendet, da es auf <body> nicht funktioniert
obwohl <body> das parent-element fÃ¼r .top und .bot ist. sehr mystisch...


ARRAY-STRUCTURE ZU card_html():
$array = [["image path","plant name","plant description",price as int]]

ARRAY-STRUCTURE ZU dropdown_html():
$array = [["colum",[["link1", "description1"],["link2", "description2"]]]]


When you write a function for an EventListener in Javascript,
you pass in the functions name into the EventListeners second parameter
without parenthesis and add "event" as parameter to the function.
The event Element can be targeted with: var myElem = event.target;


When handling the appearance of different divs, the style must have been set
in the HTML Document. Otherwise Javascript cannot get ".style.display".
Javascript does not read the styles in CSS.


The shopping-cart (.car-row inside .cart_items) gets completely generated in Javascript.
When loading the page .cart_items div is invisible. By clicking the addToCartButton .cart_items
gets appended with a cart-row which contains all info shown in .card. By clicking the remove-from-cart-button
which gets generated with the .cart-row, the .cart-row gets deleted.

From the checkout-div, the data gets send to checkout.php via an AJAX Request.
An AJAX Request is used because the item+quantity data is located outside the checkout-div (in .cart_items),
in which commonly a html-form would be used to transmit data to php.
The Data contains:
  ->the Total Price
  ->selected Item/s with quantity
  ->customer data

The admin.html is styled with css grid.
